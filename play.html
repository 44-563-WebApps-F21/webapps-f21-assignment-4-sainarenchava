            _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.<br>
            [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
            armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
            _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
            _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]
        </h5>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="speech"> I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim
held out to you.</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick
of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is
weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible
temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.
To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no
weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that
courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the
letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over
the transaction.</p>

<h6 class=" name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="speech">And you?</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech">I received from the Baron £110,000.</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING ">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="speech">You were worth more, Robert.</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech">No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power
over others.  I went into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in
finance from time to time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my
fortune.  Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a
success.  In all things connected with money I have had a luck so
extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  I remember
having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to
punish us they answer our prayers.</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="speech"> But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for
what you had done?</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="speech">No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its
own weapons, and won.</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Sadly_.]</p>  <p class="speech">You thought you had won.</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech">I thought so. <p class="stage-direction"> [_After a long pause_.] </p> Arthur, do
you despise me for what I have told you?</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_With deep feeling in his voice_.] </p> <p class="speech"> I am very sorry for
you, Robert, very sorry indeed.</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech"> I don’t say that I suffered any remorse.  I didn’t.
Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.  But I have
paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that I might disarm
destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in
public charities since then.</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stage-direction">  [_Looking up_.] </p> <p class="speech"> In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot
of harm you must have done, Robert!</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Oh, don’t say that, Arthur; don’t talk like that!</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="speech"> Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I
shouldn’t say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A great
mistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  As
regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can.
Of course you know that.</p>

<h6 class="name SIR-ROBERT-CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech">  Thank you, Arthur, thank you.  But what is to be
done?  What can be done?</p>

<h6 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Leaning back with his hands in his pockets_.] </p> <p class="speech"> Well, the
English can’t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, but
they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.  It
is one of the best things in them.  However, in your case, Robert, a
confession would not do.  The money, if you will allow me to say so, is
. . . awkward.  Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole
affair, you would never be able to talk morality again.  And in England a
man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral
audience is quite over as a serious politician.  There would be nothing
left for him as a profession except Botany or the Church.  A confession
would be of no use.  It would ruin you.</p>
